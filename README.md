# ProScout
ProScout is a Java-based football player recommendation system that leverages Neo4j as its database and Quarkus as its web framework. The system is designed to help professional football clubs and scouts identify and recruit talented players who are likely to perform well in their teams.

ProScout allows users to input player data such as age, position, playing style, nationality, and performance metrics, which are then stored in the Neo4j database. The system uses advanced algorithms and machine learning models to analyze the data and generate personalized recommendations for each user based on their preferences and criteria.

ProScout provides a user-friendly interface that enables users to easily search and filter player profiles, view detailed statistics and performance metrics, and compare players side-by-side. The system also includes features for managing player scouting reports, tracking player progress, and monitoring player contracts and transfers.

ProScout is built using modern software development practices and tools, including Quarkus for its lightweight and fast microservices architecture and Neo4j for its graph database capabilities and flexibility. The system is scalable, secure, and easy to deploy on any cloud infrastructure.
